# LeanOpenSource
The word "lean" has been around quite a while and mostly in the start up environment. This user account is for taking the learnings of lean and applying it to a new space open source.
- We are writing daily about new ideas on libraries
- We experiment quickly with our ideas without spending too much of our time going into depth
- When verifying our ideas to have potentially success we team up to create an MVP
- Everyone is welcome in this community who strongly believes in our core values and respects our code of conduct
- We meet weekly on Mondays to discuss our latest findings and ideas
