# LeanOpenSource
Applying the lean principles to the open source space while focussing on the greater good:
- We write daily about new open source products
- We take those ideas to quick experiments to verify our hypotheses
- When validating our hypotheses we team up to create first product versions MVPs

Everyone is welcome to the Lean Open Source community who strongly believes in our core values and respects our code of conduct. We meet weekly on Mondays to discuss our latest findings and ideas. 

Please drop us an email for any feedback or input you have to tell us:
